Smoke on the Water
Deep Purple
Machine Head
1972
We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water
We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside, ha
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds, huh
We made a place to sweat
No matter what we get out of this, ha
I know, I know we'll never forget
Smoke on the water, a fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

Crazy Train
Ozzy Osbourne
Blizzard of Ozz
1981
All aboard Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay
Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love
And forget how to hate
Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
Let's go
I've listened to preachers
I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts
Who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it, and you live the role
Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words, yeah
Heirs of a cold war
That's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something that just isn't fair
Mental wounds not healing
Who and what's to blame?
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train

War Pigs
Black Sabbath
Paranoid
1970
Generals gathered in their masses,
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction,
Sorcerer of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning,
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind,
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh Lord yeah
Politicians hide themselves away
They only started the war
Why should they go out to fight?
They leave that role for the poor, yeah
Time will tell on their power minds,
Making war just for fun
Treating people just like pawns in chess,
Wait 'till their judgment day comes, yeah
Now in darkness world stops turning,
Ashes where the bodies burning
No more War Pigs have the power,
Hand of God has struck the hour
Day of judgment, God is calling
On their knees the war pigs crawling,
Begging mercies for their sins
Satan, laughing, spreads his wings
Oh Lord yeah

The Trooper
Iron Maiden
Piece of Mind
1983
You'll take my life but I'll take yours, too
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds as the charge begins
But on this battlefield no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horses' breath
As you plunge into a certain death
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
The horse he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear I draw my parting groan
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

Riding on the Wind
Judas Priest
Screaming for Vengeance
1982
Shooting for the stars
Cruise the speed of light
Glowing god of Mars
Body burning bright
Well I'm riding, riding on the wind
Yes I'm riding, riding on the wind
Tearing up through life
Million miles an hour
Blinding all in sight
Surging rush of power
Thunderbolt from hell
Shattering aloud
Screaming demons yell
Bursting through the clouds

Still of the Night
Whitesnake
Whitesnake
1987
In the still of the night
I hear the wolf howl, honey
Sniffing around your door
In the still of the night
I feel my heart beating heavy
Telling me I gotta have more
In the shadow of night
I see the full moon rise
Telling me what's in store

An' taste your love so sweet
And I just want to make love to you

And hide my face from the sun
Through the light of the day
Until the evening time
I'm waiting for the night to come
Ooh, baby

In the cool moonlight
I feel my heart is aching
In the still of the night
Ooh, baby, Ooh, baby
Can't keep away

And I just wanna make love to you

Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night
Still of the night, still of the night, still of the night

For Whom the Bell Tolls
Metallica
Ride the Lightning
1984
Make his fight on the hill in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun, on they run through the endless grey
On they fight, for they're right, yes, but who's to say?
For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
Stiffened wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain that they surely know
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls
Take a look to the sky just before you die
It's the last time you will
Blackened roar, massive roar, fills the crumbling sky
Shattered goal fills his soul with a ruthless cry
Stranger now, are his eyes, to this mystery
He hears the silence so loud
Crack of dawn, all is gone except the will to be
Now they see what will be, blinded eyes to see
For whom the bell tolls
Time marches on
For whom the bell tolls

Hells Bells
AC/DC
Back in Black
1980
I'm rolling thunder, a pouring rain
I'm comin' on like a hurricane
There's lightning's flashing across the sky
You're only young, but you're gonna die
Won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's putting up a fight
Took my bell, take you to hell
Satan get you, Satan get you
Hell's bells
Yeah, Hell's bells
You got me ringing, Hell's bells
My temperature's high, Hell's bells
You get the flame
I'll give you black sensations up and down your spine
If you're into evil, you're a friend of mine
See my white light flashing as I split the night
God's on the left, I'm stickin' to the right
Won't take no prisoners, won't spare no lives
Nobody's puttin' up a fight
Take my bell, take you to hell
Satan get you, Satan get you
Hell's bells
Ah, Hell's bells
You got me ringing, Hell's bells
My temperature's high, Hell's bells
You're gonna get... yeah, yeah
Yeah
Hell's bells, Satan's comin' to you
Hell's bells, the cross is dead
Hell's bells, we're takin' you under
Hell's bells, you're gonna fry
Hell's bells, they're takin' you down
Hell's bells, underground
Hell's bells, gonna split the night
Hell's bells, nowhere to hide
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
Hell's bells, yeah

Symphony of Destruction
Megadeth
Countdown to Extinction
1992
You take a mortal man
And put him in control
Watch him become a god
Watch people's heads a'roll
A'roll, a' roll
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like the marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Of destruction
Acting like a robot
Its metal brain corrodes
You try to take its pulse
Before the head explodes
Explodes, explodes
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony
Of destruction
The earth starts to rumble
World powers fall
A'warring for the heavens
A peaceful man stands tall
Tall, tall
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Just like the Pied Piper
Led rats through the streets
We dance like marionettes
Swaying to the symphony
Swaying to the symphony
Of destruction

I Stand Alone
Godsmack
Faceless
2003
Now I've told you this once before
You can't control me
If you try to take me down you're gonna break
I feel your every nothing that you're doing for me
I'm picking you out of me
You run away
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
You're always hiding behind your so called goddess
So what you don't think that we can see your face
Resurrected back before the final fallen
Now they've arrest until I can make my own way
I'm not afraid of fading
I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me
I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
And now its my time (now its my time)
It's my time to dream (my time to dream)
Dream of the sky (dream of the sky)
Make me believe that this place is inplagued
By the poison in me
Help me decide if my fire will burn out
Before you can breathe
Breathe into me
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Feeling your sting down inside me
I'm not dying for it
I stand alone
Everything that I believe is fading
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Inside
I stand alone
Inside

Rock You Like a Hurricane
Scorpions
Love at First Sting
1984
It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?
The bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breaks out loud
Lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (are you ready, baby?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (come on, come on, baby)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Rock you like a hurricane
It's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin?
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for love at first sting
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (are you ready, baby?)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane (come on, come on, come on, come on)
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am

God Damn
Avenged Sevenfold
Avenged Sevenfold
2016
Oh!
Hey! Can't you see we're tripping on the wire
Walking through the candy land of our desires
Press the magic button and behold the world you crave
Where's the fun in freedom when it renders you a slave?
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
Hey! It goes beyond big brother in the sky
Beyond the threat of martial law no Horus eye
No one came to cuff you they just handed you the chains
Blind follows the blind and now the one-eyed man is king
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed
No form of payment, no pot of gold will satisfy the debt of what he's owed
Spilling from the houses in a trance the children lined up on the road
Cursing at the piper as he lured your kids away
And led them to the river for what was their final day
No need for convincing on his pipe he played a song to fool them all
Fooled them all
Pledge allegiance, no flag
God nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorn
And now the fire keeps us (keeps us)
Tunnel vision, no man
Damnation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed

Crooked Teeth
Papa Roach
Papa Roach
2017
Locked up in my hurricane head
Bloody knuckles paint the whole place red
Straightjacket, straight tie me to the bed
All alone in a room full of misfits
Cold blooded, cold hearted on a hit list
Paranoid, struggling, I gotta kick this
Everybody's looking at me, staring at me
Everybody's looking at me
Terrified, paralyzed
Something's got a hold on me
Let me go, I can't speak
I'm choking on my crooked teeth
Wake me up if I sleep
Cause I'm haunted by my dreams
Crying out, but I can't speak
Cause I'm choking on my, choking on my
Crooked teeth
My crooked teeth
Caved in, hyperventilating
Cutting way too close to my skin
I feel the devil trying to creep back in
I feel the devil trying to creep back in
I'm possessed by the every day stress
Flash back and I'm trying to forget
Bloody hell, bloody knife, bloody mess
Terrified, paralyzed
Something's got a hold on me
Let me go, I can't speak
I'm choking on my crooked teeth
Wake me up if I sleep
Cause I'm haunted by my dreams
Crying out, but I can't speak
Cause I'm choking on my, choking on my
Crooked teeth
Everybody's looking at me, staring at me
Everybody's looking at me﻿
Everybody's looking at me, staring at me
Everybody's looking at me﻿
Terrified, paralyzed
Something's got a hold on me
Let me go, I can't speak
I'm choking on my crooked teeth
Wake me up if I sleep
Cause I'm haunted by my dreams
Crying out, but I can't speak
Cause I'm choking on my, choking on my
Crooked teeth
My crooked teeth
